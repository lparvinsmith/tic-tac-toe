# tic-tac-toe
first WDI project


TECHNOLOGIES USED:
JavaScript for game logic
JQuery and for user interaction
HTML/CSS & Bootstrap for layout and style
AJAX for data storage and retrieval

APPROACH:
Planned app layout and functionality using wireframe and user stories, and used HTML and CSS for basic layout.
Constructed game logic in game.js, using JavaScript to determine orders and outcomes. Then created ui.js to handle DOM manipulation and event handling, with game.js feeding into it.
Re-positioned and re-styled with Bootstrap, for more responsive layout.
Added AJAX to front-end to connect to server and allow players to choose an opponent virtually


UNSOLVED PROBLEMS?
-need to test AJAX component using server and ensure linkage with backend.
-reformat files to use with browserify
-do fun stuff for if one player wins three in a row, etc
