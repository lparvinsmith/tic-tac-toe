# tic-tac-toe
first WDI project


TECHNOLOGIES USED:
JavaScript for game logic
JQuery and for user interaction
HTML/CSS & Bootstrap for layout and style


APPROACH:
This app updates a classic game, tic-tac-toe, to increase competition between two opponents. The rules of the game follow the same simple norms of the classic version, with a new element of the winner of the previous game getting to go first in the next game. There is also scoreboard to track wins.
The layout and design is meant to be simple and non-distracting, so the players can focus on the game.


UNSOLVED PROBLEMS?
-reformat files to use with browserify
-do fun stuff for if one player wins three in a row, etc
